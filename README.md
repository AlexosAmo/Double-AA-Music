### Color Scheme
The player uses a customizable color palette:
- **Primary Color**: `#5D5CDE` (Purple-blue)
- **Background**: `#FFFFFF` (Light) / `#181818` (Dark)
- **Gradient**: Purple to blue for the main player area

### Adding Custom Tracks
To add more tracks, modify the `tracks` array in the JavaScript:

```javascript
const tracks = [
    { 
        title: "Your Track Name", 
        artist: "Artist Name", 
        frequency: 440, // Hz frequency for the tone
        emoji: "🎵" // Visual representation
    },
    // Add more tracks here...
];
